***Abandoned Car in Basement Procedure*** 

Please follow the below procedure when you attend site and find a car illegally dumped in the basement. 

**Step 1:** Try and identify who owns the car by placing notices throughout the lifts and on the car regarding breaching the by-laws. Review the CCTV to see who may own the car and email the committee. 

**Step 2:** Phone the police and check to see if the car has been stolen. Quote the number plate to the police officer. They may also run the type of car in their system to see if it matches to any illegal activity.
