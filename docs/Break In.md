#### Break-In Procedure 

If a resident phone in and informs you that there has been a break-in, please follow the below steps:  

**Step 1**:  

• Inform the resident to contact the police straight away and have them attend site. They could then request for fingerprints to be retrieved from the site and will provide an event number. 

**Step 2**: 

• Inform the Strata Committee of the situation. 

 **“It has been brought to our attention that ______. Please ensure that all cars are locked, there are no valuables in the storage cages/cars and to be mindful of who is around you whilst walking on the Common Property”.**  

**Step 3**:  

• Check the CCTV footage (if available) when you are next on site. Please note, if it is a serious crime, you may need to attend that day and arrive ASAP to check the footage/speak to police.  

• Ask the resident for an approx. time that this occurred so that you can then work out how much footage needs to be reviewed.  

• If the footage does show what has happened, you will then need to download the footage onto a USB and take it to the police station. 

**PLEASE NOTE: NEVER HAND THE FOOTAGE TO A RESIDENT PRIOR TO GIVING IT TO THE POLICE – The footage can be handed over if the resident is a Strata Committee member OR if it has been approved by management.**  

**Step 4**:

 • Complete a full sweep of the building. Check the storage cages, locks, check for smashed glass, other cars etc.  

• If you find anything suspicious – report back to the police with the information.  

**Step 5**:  

• Report any findings back to the Strata Committee in an email. Inform them of whether you found anything on the CCTV footage OR if you found the location as to where the thief entered.  

**Step 6**:  

• Report back to the resident who reported the Break-In.  

**Step 7**:  

• Notices will need to be placed up around the building. These notices should include a brief recount of what has happened (e.g. location of break-in, how they got in (if identified) and that police are investigating). You should also inform residents to be mindful of who is around them and to ensure that no residents follow them through the gate when entering or existing and to not give access to residents who buzz through requesting access due to losing their keys etc.
