#### Installing Floorboards in Units Procedure 

If a resident phones/emails through wanting to install new floor coverings in their apartment, you must follow this procedure.  

**Step 1**: 

Check the By-Laws for the site as each building is different.  

An example of the By-law is below:

**Step 2**:

 Most By-laws will state that it needs to be approved by the Strata Committee prior to going ahead.  

ALL new floor installers must have 4-star AAAC impact rating for floors, being the rating set by the association of the Australian Acoustical Consultants.  The floor must also result in or satisfy an Lâ€™nT,w Rating of 50 or less.  

**Step 3**:

 If all is to go ahead, the resident must comply with the underlay/gradient that passes the acoustic certificate. Once the resident receives this certificate then the building manager must pass this onto the Committee.
