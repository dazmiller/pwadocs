#### LIFT OUT OF SERVICE Procedure 

If there are reports of a LIFT OUT OF SERVICE on your site, you must follow the below procedures: 

1. Phone the Company and request a technician attends asap. Make sure you get the following information: 

- Persons name that you are speaking too 

- Reference for the booking 

- Estimated Time of Arrival 


Once you have the above information, you can then send out a broadcast to all residents informing them that the lift is out of service. 

**Please note - if you are unsure as to how to send out a broadcast, please refer to the [BroadCast Procedure Documentation](Broadcast Procedure.md) for further details.**

The following is how you should work the broadcast to all residents:  

**SUBJECT OF BROADCAST: RE: SP ___ | __(ADDRESS)____ | LIFT OUT OF SERVICE** 

BODY OF EMAIL: 

Dear Resident, 

It has been brought to our attention that the lift ***(location)*** is currently out of service. We would like to inform all residents that we have already contacted the lift company and a technician will be arriving ***(insert the estimated time of arrival from phone call)***. 


The reference number for the technician attending site is: ***(Insert reference number)***. 

Please refrain from contacting the lift company as they would be receiving a high number of phone calls at this time. If you would like any updates, please phone me on ***(Insert Building Managers number)***.  
As soon as I hear any further updates on when the lift will be in working condition, I will be sure to update you all via a further broadcast.  

Kind Regards, 

 Building Managet

Please ensure that you remember to update all residents via broadcast when you receive confirmation from the technician that the lift is up and running. If they require further parts of more time, you will need to continue to update the residents via further broadcasts.
