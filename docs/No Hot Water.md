#### No Hot Water Procedure 

**Resident**: “*I have no hot water in my unit*”  

**Step 1**:  Firstly, find out how many units do not have hot water.    

**<u>Hot Water System - multiple apartments</u>**

 Firstly, If there is no hot water in **<u>multiple apartments</u>**, you must notify the committee and the strata manager  

• If the building **<u>IS</u>** connected via an embedded network:  

Check to see if the building is connected via an embedded network. If the building is connected via an embedded network, then you would engage that company particular company e.g. Arc Energy, Origin, WIN, OC Energy, Energy trade.   

• If the building **<u>IS NOT</u>** connected via an embedded network:  

You will then need to engage a plumber and have them investigate the problem. The plumber should be the preferred contractor for that site.   

**<u>Hot Water System – One Apartment</u>**

 Once you have identified if it was just one person, wait 30-45 minutes and see if any other residents phone through.  Email through to the committee to see if anyone else is experiencing the same problem.  

If no other residents call, try and push it through to the next day if the resident can wait. If no one else phones through, then we can pass on the Plumbers details and inform them that it is an isolated problem within their unit.
