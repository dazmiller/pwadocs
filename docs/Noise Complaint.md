#### Noise Complaint Procedure 

If you receive a complaint from one resident or multiple residents regarding noise you must following these steps.  

**Step 1**: Try and pin point where the noise is coming from.  

**Step 2**: If you are able to pin point where the noise is coming from you can then check the MYBOS system or your emails to see if you have any contact details for this particular resident.  

**Step 3**: If you do not have the contact details it would be best to go back to the residents that are complaining and request that they phone the police. The police will then attend and request that they either turn down their music or shut down the party.  

**Step 4**: On the next working day, you must then make up a notice (example below). This is to be placed into the lifts and if you are aware of which unit was making the noise, then you must place the by-law breach under the unit’s door as well. Take a photo of this so that you have the proof and log the By-Law Breach into the MYBOS system under that specific unit.
