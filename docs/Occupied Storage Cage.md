#### STORAGE CAGE OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER RESIDENT  

If a resident emails or phones you regarding a resident storing their items in their storage cage, please follow the below steps:   

1. Confirm with the strata plan to make sure that the resident is correct. Confirm the cage location for that specific resident.  

2. When on site, investigate what is happening as per the resident’s information and the strata plan. 

3. Try to make contact with the person who owns the good in the cage. Find out if there is any way they may have been confused. If you make contact with the resident, then inform them that they have 5 days to move it to the correct storage cage. Provide them with the location of their correct storage cage.   

4. If you cannot make contact with the resident or the person involved, we would then create a notice to give them 5 days warning that the goods will be removed. This notice would be placed on the storage cage, under the apartment door of the suspected unit that could be confused, and in the lift to notify any residents that it could be in the building.   

5. ***Take pictures so that you have evidence of doing all three of the above.***  

After the 5 days has been given, we then (if possible) move the goods to a storage room or second location to store. The resident will then contact you when they realise that their goods have been taken. Ensure that the place you store the goods is locked and secure so that nothing is stolen in the meantime.  

If no storage room is available, then we have to deem it as rubbish as per the notice that you provided to the resident.   

*Please remember: Make sure you provide all the correct contact details on the notice so that the resident can make contact with you to organise a time to collect or remove the goods.*    

 Please see an example of the notice to be placed in the lifts, under the unit door and on the goods that have been stored in the basement.
