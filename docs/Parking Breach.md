**Step 4**: Select the date the parking breach occurred, the vehicle registration number, make and model of the car and the breach that they are breaking (e.g. By-Law 3 – Vehicle – Visitor Parking Breach).  

**Step 5**: Add a photo of the car that is breaching the By-Law. It is best to have the time and date on the photo so that you can always go back and provide evidence of someone parking in the visitor parking bay and have the date for reference in case the matter is taken further.
