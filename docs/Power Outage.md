#### Power Outage Procedure 

Phone call comes through and someone in the apartment reports that their power is out.  

There are 3 possibilities:  

1. Bill Overdue 
2. Whole building is having a power outage in the area 
3. The power in the apartment has tripped.  

**These are the steps to follow:**  

Wait 20 minutes to see if any other residents phone up and report that their power is out. If they don’t then it narrows it down to the one apartment. 

NOTE: If more residents call, then it means that there must be a power outage within the whole building. (Go straight to point number 2 below).  

**Try to determine how the power outage has occurred. Ask the following questions:**

- How did it happen?
- Did you plug something into the wall that could have caused this? (old fridge/kettle for example). 
- Who is your electricity provider?  For example: AGL, Origin, Arc Energy, Win Energy etc.  

<u>Possibilities</u>:  

1. **<u>BILL OVERDUE</u>**
   Phone their provider and find out if they have any money owing on their account. Depending on their answer this could be the cause. 
   If Yes – Phone the resident back and inform them that the power outage is due to the overdue bill. Request that they phone their provider and pay the bill to have the power connected again.  
   If No – Move onto the next step.  

2. **<u>WHOLE BUILDING OUTAGE</u>**
   Go to the Ausgrid website (https://www.ausgrid.com.au/Outages/Power-outages) and place the address into the top bar. This will determine if there is a power outage for the area.  If there is a power outage, then you will need to phone the residents back and inform them that there is a power outage and keep them updated of the situation.  You will need to update the Strata Manager and Strata Committee via email and keep them updated of the progress.  

3. **<u>POWER HAS TRIPPED</u>**
   Find out the answers to the above questions (How did it happen? Did you plug an old appliance into a power point?) 
   Once you have the answers to those questions you MUST state the following:  **“I am happy to organise an electrician to attend site although if they deem the problem as the resident being at fault then the cost will then be the residents responsibility”.**  


Have the resident **<u>confirm in writing via email</u>** that they approve the above comment and then have an electrician attend site.  Make sure to keep updated with the electrician and find out as to what the problem was. It would be best for you to ask them to email you a report of what occurred so that if they deem it the resident’s responsibility then you have it in writing to pass onto the resident with the invoice for them to pay.
