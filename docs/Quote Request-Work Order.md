#### Quote Request/Work Order Procedure 

Please find below the procedure when sending a Quote Request or Work Order out to any contractors for all sites.  

**Quote Requests & Work Orders:**

When sending a Quote Request or Work Order, we are now asking for all managers to phone the companies that they send the Quote Requests too and find out the following:  


1. Would they be able to complete the quote request/work order?  
2. What is the lead time on the quote request/work order if it is being sent?  
3. Confirm the email address (if a new contractor). 


If all managers are following the above, this will avoid sending quote requests/work orders and companies not getting back to you if they are not interested. When companies do not get back to us, the Quote/Work order then slips our minds because we are then waiting on them to get back to us and they have no intention too.
