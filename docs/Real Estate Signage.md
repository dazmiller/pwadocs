**Real Estate Signage Procedure** 

If a report is received regarding there being a “FOR SALE” or “FOR LEASE/RENT” real estate advertisement or signage within the building, please follow the below steps.  

**Step 1**: Check the Buildings By-laws to see if there is anything relating to the real estate signage place within the building.  

**Step 2**: Check is owner has had any written approval that would allow them to have the signage in place.  

**Step 3**: Inform the committee of the signage and request further instruction on what action they would like you to take.  

**Step 4**: Depending on the committee’s instructions, you will then contact the Real Estate agency who has the signage on site and request for it to be removed within a reasonable time frame (e.g. 5 days’ notice).  

If the Real Estate company do not comply with the requirements, you will then need to refer back to the committee with an update and provide solutions on the removal of the sign
