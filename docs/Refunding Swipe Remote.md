#### Refunding Swipe Card/Garage Remote Procedure 

If a resident wishes to hand back their swipe/garage remote and receive a refund the building manager must follow the below process.  

 **Step 1**: Check and see if they are eligible for a refund. Some sites do not offer refunds on the swipes/remote. You can check with the Strata Manager or ask the SBAFM Office.  

**Step 2**: Request the receipt from the Resident. Without the receipt you are then unable to process through the refund.  

**Step 3**: Meet with the resident on site and confirm that the swipe/remote is in working condition. If it does not, you cannot proceed with the refund.  

**Step 4**: Request that the resident sends their bank details (BSB & Account Number) via email. Once you receive this you can then send through to Strata along with the receipt and request the refund is to be processed into the residents account.  

**Step 5**: When you receive confirmation from the Strata Manager you can then go back to resident and inform them that the refund should appear in their account within 1-3 business days.
