**Smoke Alarm Procedure** 

If a resident contacts you regarding the Smoke Alarm beeping, please follow the steps below:  

Please note: The changing of the battery in the Smoke Alarm is the responsibility of the owner.  

**Step 1**: Request that they try and change the battery in the smoke alarm prior to moving forward. If they change the battery and it works, then this would be classified as being a closed case. 

 **Step 2**:  If Step 1 does not stop the beeping, you will need to refer it back to the builder via the MYBOS system (Creating a case) for them to check and see if it is under the Manufacturerâ€™s Warranty.  

**Step 3**: If it is out of the Manufactures warranty you must then check the buildings by-laws (As each building is different) and see if there is any further information relation to the smoke alarms.  

**Step 4**: Send it onto the Strata Manager and inform the that it is out of the Manufacture Warranty period and suggest sending a work order to the fire contractor to have them attend site and repair.
