**Step 3**: Upload the photo of vehicle to MYBOS in the parking breaches section (using the “Uploading Parking Breaches in MYBOS Procedure) 

**Step 4**: Re-check visitor parking in 24 hours, if vehicle with notice is still in the same spot proceed to clamp the wheel. Take photo of wheel before and after the clamp is placing to ensure there is no damaged cause when applying the clamp. 

**Step 5**: Add photos of wheel clamping to MYBOS
